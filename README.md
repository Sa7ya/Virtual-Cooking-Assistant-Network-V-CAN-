# Virtual-Cooking-Assistant-Network-V-CAN-
A Mobile App that recognizes both Indian and Non-Indian food from images using deep learning techniques and training it on a merged dataset of Food-101 and Food-20 with a simple calorie estimation approach to track calories along with a question answering system based on BERT using transcripts of food recipes.
ABSTRACT
A major concern in today's pandemic era is the rapid increase in obesity and other health
related chronic diseases based on poor nutrition and diet. Traditional cooking assistant systems as
well as calorie tracker applications are tedious to use and lack user friendly features. Additionally
the current systems do not work on localized Indian food. In this paper, we present a proof of
concept for an efficient cooking assistant system which can automatically detect food and its
caloric value from the images captured with a mobile phone camera using deep learning neural
networks for image recognition as well as a question answering system based on the transcript of
the food recipes. The primary objective of this project is to provide people with an assistance tool
for their daily based cooking experience as well as track their calories to promote proper diet
which in turn ensures the person is healthy. We also aim to broaden people's knowledge about
nutrition, making them more aware of the food they consume on a daily basis. This system will
also be easily accessible since it will be deployed in an Android smartphone.
